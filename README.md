(i) data analysis code
(ii) source data

** Behavior data analysis code: MS_data_analysis_eLife_rev_GitHub_1p2.ipynb

This code is used to analyze segmented behavioral data. The UMAPs can be plotted and colored according to the behavioral features or cluster (class) membership.

The segments (individual leg movements) are described by various features and classified in several types of behavior (such as head cleaning or front leg cleaning). *** LMM fitting is performed in the “ --- LMM Main Script ---” cell. *** The code can be used to plot comparisons between groups for feature-class pairs. Variabilities of feature-class pairs can also be compared in the second part of the code file.
